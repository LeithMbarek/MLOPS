## Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive system for determining loan payment outcomes. The pipeline is designed to handle real-world complexities like missing data, imbalanced classes, and scalable deployment.

### Key Objectives:
- Build a robust machine learning model for loan payment prediction.
- Deploy the model using FastAPI for integration with external systems.
- Provide an interactive Streamlit dashboard for users to visualize predictions and explore insights.
- Implement model monitoring with Arize AI to ensure consistent performance post-deployment.

## Project Workflow
1. Data Analysis and Preprocessing.
2. Model Development and Evaluation.
3. Experiment Tracking with MLflow.
4. API Deployment for Predictions.
5. Interactive Dashboard for End Users.
6. Continuous Monitoring and Feedback Loop.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, FastAPI, Streamlit
- **Model Tracking**: MLflow
- **Deployment Tools**: FastAPI, Streamlit
- **Monitoring**: Arize AI

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understand the dataset and identify patterns, trends, and outliers.
- Key activities include descriptive statistics, visualizations, and class imbalance analysis.

**Tools Used**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas Profiling

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values using imputation techniques.
- Create new features (e.g., loan-to-income ratio).
- Normalize numeric data and encode categorical variables.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Address class imbalance using SMOTE.

**Tools Used**: Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn

### 3. Model Development
- Test algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
- Finalize the XGBoost model for deployment.

**Tools Used**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost

### 4. Experiment Tracking with MLflow
- Capture key metrics and hyperparameters for reproducibility.
- Save the best-performing model for deployment.

**Tools Used**: MLflow, SQLite

### 5. API Deployment with FastAPI
- Develop a FastAPI-based RESTful API with endpoints for predictions and health monitoring.
- Dockerize the application for portability.

**Endpoints**:
- `/predict`: Accepts JSON payloads and returns predictions.
- `/health`: Monitors API health.

**Tools Used**: FastAPI, Uvicorn

### 6. Frontend Visualization with Streamlit
- Create an interactive dashboard for model predictions and insights.
- Enable users to upload datasets and analyze trends.

**Tools Used**: Streamlit

### 7. Monitoring with Arize AI
- Log training and inference datasets with features, predictions, and actual outcomes.
- Track metrics like accuracy drift, data drift, and feature importance changes.

**Tools Used**: Arize AI SDK
